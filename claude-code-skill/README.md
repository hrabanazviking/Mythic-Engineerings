# Mythic Engineering — Claude Code Skill

---

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrabanazviking/Mythic-Engineering/refs/heads/main/8c9718dc-9234-4e6b-833f-8f78d625d933.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrabanazviking/Mythic-Engineering/refs/heads/main/8c9718dc-9234-4e6b-833f-8f78d625d933.jpg)

---

A Claude Code skill that activates the full **Mythic Engineering** methodology for any software project.

Invoke it at the start of any session to orient Claude Code to architecture-first, document-guided, AI-orchestrated development.

---

## What It Does

When you type `/mythic-engineering:mythic-engineering` in Claude Code (plugin install), or `/mythic-engineering` (manual install), it activates:

- **Six Specialist Roles** — Sigrún (Skald), Rúnhild (Architect), Eldra (Forge Worker), Sólrún (Auditor), Védis (Cartographer), Eirwyn (Scribe)
- **Session Start Protocol** — mandatory orientation before touching any code (read TODO, scout codebase, write TASK file, report, wait for approval)
- **The Five-Layer Architecture Model** — Vision → Domain → Interface → Execution → Verification
- **Immutable Coding Laws** — no pseudocode, no absolute paths, no hardcoded data, full files only, additive fixes only, finish all connections
- **Full ME Protocol** — 8-phase workflow, daily routine, quickstart checklists, prompt design structure, all templates

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

The `claude-code-skill/` directory is a self-contained Claude Code plugin. Load it with:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/Mythic-Engineering/claude-code-skill
```

Or from inside the `claude-code-skill/` directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir .
```

Once loaded, the skill is namespaced as `/mythic-engineering:mythic-engineering`.

### Option 2 — Manual project scope

Copy the skill into your project's Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/mythic-engineering
cp /path/to/Mythic-Engineering/claude-code-skill/skills/mythic-engineering/SKILL.md .claude/skills/mythic-engineering/SKILL.md
```

Commit it so every collaborator gets it:

```bash
git add .claude/skills/mythic-engineering/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Mythic Engineering Claude Code skill"
```

Invoked as `/mythic-engineering`.

### Option 3 — Manual global scope (all your projects)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/mythic-engineering
cp /path/to/Mythic-Engineering/claude-code-skill/skills/mythic-engineering/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/mythic-engineering/SKILL.md
```

Invoked as `/mythic-engineering`.

---

## Usage

**Plugin install — session start:**
```
/mythic-engineering:mythic-engineering
```

**Plugin install — specific role:**
```
/mythic-engineering:mythic-engineering architect
```

**Plugin install — specific task:**
```
/mythic-engineering:mythic-engineering refactor the memory module to use internal APIs
```

**Manual install (same skill, no namespace prefix):**
```
/mythic-engineering
/mythic-engineering forge
/mythic-engineering analyze the current architecture and identify ME violations
```

## The Core Philosophy

> *GSD burns out. Superpowers fail under pressure. Prompt engineering is mostly hype.*
> *Mythic Engineering builds software as a living system.*

Software is not a pile of features. It is a living structure made of domains, rules, interfaces, memory, flows, constraints, and emergent behavior. This skill keeps Claude Code aligned with that truth.
